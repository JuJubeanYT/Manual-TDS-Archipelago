# Manual TDS Archipelago
Should be mostly self explanatory but just in case I will clarify things

- Start with Scout, Sniper, and easy mode.
- The modes should be done IN ORDER.
- Make sure to disable auto skip and skill tree until you get them.
- Play solo
- Be prepared to use 90% of your brain power.
- Have fun.

YAML settings will most likely be added with tesla tower on 1/28
